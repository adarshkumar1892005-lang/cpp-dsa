# C++ DSA Practice

This repository contains my C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms practice code.  
I am a 1st year BTech IT student learning C++ after C and Python, and using this repo to track my daily progress.

## What’s inside

- `01_basics_cpp/`
  - Basic C++ programs using `cin` / `cout`
  - Simple problems: printing hello world, even/odd, calculator, greetings, etc.
- More folders will be added for:
  - Arrays and strings
  - Functions and recursion
  - OOP in C++
  - DSA topics (linked list, stack, queue, trees, graphs, DP)

## Goals

- Get comfortable with modern C++ syntax.
- Use C++ as the main language for DSA (Love Babbar / Supreme, LeetCode, etc.).
- Build a consistent GitHub history by coding and committing daily.
